# Best practices

The following simple techiques helped me and other developers to improve the documentation for software they write.

Now they even like writing and updating the documentation.

# Writing documentation = Bad time?

Sometimes true.

# Signs for bad documentation

- **Permissions:** You need permissions to access the Wiki page for the project to see documentation about the project
- **Outdated:** You find outdated documentation and need to rewrite all because the software changed so much
- **Can not edit:** Content is hard to edit e.g. Diagrams and you need proprietary tools and licenses that you don't have or want to buy

# NO Documentation = bad time!

Always true.

# How do I write agile documentation?

## Do I need to learn new tools? NO!
## Does it slow me down? NO!
## Easy version control? YES!

---
class: middle

# Why is that 'agile'?

Because you handle change with confidence.

# Rules

1. Use plain text wherever possible (diagrams, lists)
1. Treat commit messages as documentation
1. Add a `README.md` to project root (`.md` = `markdown`)
1. Keep your docs <span title="Do not repeat yourself!">DRY</span> with hyperlinks (connect, not duplicate)
1. PRO: Create diagrams with `seqdiag`
1. PRO: Create presentations with HTML e.g. remark

# Commit messages are _the brain_ of the project

- Help you remember _who_ changed code, _why_ and _when_
- Use the version control as documentation FOR YOURSELF!
- 'I can't remember why I did this' is the worst.
- Better say: Wait, I'll look it up.

# Good commit message

```
Redirect user to the requested page after login

https://trello.com/path/to/relevant/card

Users were being redirected to the home page after login, which is less
useful than redirecting to the page they had originally requested before
being redirected to the login form.

 * Store requested path in a session variable
 * Redirect to the stored location after successfully logging in the user

Fixes #[issue id]

# Empty commit messages make me want to cry each time…

Because it is so simple to provide more context

# README files are the starting point for the project

- Helps you to clarify the purpose of the project
- Helps others to get started
- Helps others to help you

# How to start a README?

---
class: middle

# Write it for _yourself_

- YOU are the most important person on the project and in your life
- YOU have to explain it to you first … then you have to explain it to someone else. Pseudo-Code is OK.
- YOU have to make sense of the things you code first, then others have to understand it. Make it easy for them.

---
class: middle

# Start by writing down your learnings

- Your learnings are also helpful for others.

---
class: middle

# If the README gets too big: _restructure it_

- Cleanup and update regularly
- You can create `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `LICENSE.md` or `ROADMAP.md` files too

# Benefits from writing a README

- Clarify what you want to do
- Step in others shoes by writing FAQs for them
- Great way to clarify your thoughts: If it does not fit into Plaintext - stop and clarify!
Supress the urge to open a GUI tool if it is hard to describe with plaintext

# Example README

```
For example present an overview over the project file structure

Use `tree` tool to generate and paste into the document and indent as 'monofont':

    .
    ├── README.md       - This document
    ├── infrastructure  - Infrastructure as code
    ├── ios             - iOS application
    ├── prototype       - Prototypes and examples
    ├── server          - Backend application
    └── test            - Tests for the full application stack.

# Plain text is very powerful

# If your idea is hard to put into plaintext it probably is a bad idea. ;-)
