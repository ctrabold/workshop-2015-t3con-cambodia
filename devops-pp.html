# DevOps is everything

---

# DevOps is

- From practitioners, by practitioners
- not a product, specification, job title
- an experienced-based movement
- decentralized and open for all

# Incentives - why should I do it?

- more fun

---

# How do I know I do DevOps?

## no more 'them' -> 'we'
that's why small organisations always 'do / did / have to do' DevOps…

# Signs for DevOps

How do you recognize / practice DevOps mindset games?

When you hear phrases like...
When you have questions like:

- How do we bring that product into production?
- Who will maintain it? Who is it? Where is the team? Is it a team? Is it a company?
- Get to know your service provider

---

# DevOps Practices

- Walk and Talk
- Share code
- Understand domains (languages & mindsets are totally different)
- Bring **Dev**eloper**s** and **Op**eration**s** closer together

---

# Example for different language

- Sprint Goals vs. Stability & Uptime
- Features vs. Stability

---

# DevOps & Configuration Management

Infrastructure as Code enables you to see and manage in code what else is hidden between scripts and people.

- Shared knowledge
- Transparency

---

# DevOps & Continuous Delivery

## Agile Manifesto

Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and **continuous delivery** of **valuable software**.

(http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html)

---

# Final Thoughts

- How do you ensure that you have your software always in a state that you can deliver?
- How do you make sure that the code you just committed does not harm the production environment?
